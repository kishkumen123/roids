--- What I learned ---
----------------------

2/24/2023:
    - learned the value of rect and rect helper functions

2/26/2023:
    - learned an easier way to do events from our good man JB
    - nice file separation

2/27/2023:
    - learned about worldspace, screenspace, pixelspace.
        worldspace is usually some real world unit of measurement that represent everything in the game
        screenspace is usualyl a (0 - 1) ratio of the screen w/h, which makes it easier to deal with UI elements and such
        pixelspace can be used as a representation, but it causes problems such as old games drawing small, and it is resolution dependent (Yuk!)
    - changed how I represent rects
