----------------------
----- Questions ------
----------------------

Ask about code/file organization
immediate draw? how does it work, do you immediately apply the pixels to the back buffer? do you immediately update the back buffer?


----------------------
------- To-Dos -------
----------------------

- cast glyph data to bitmap?
Rect:
    something not quite right with borders, especially when they are big and intrude

Fonts:
    add_text() maybe?
    add_text_array() maybe?
    fix gamma colors. Do a linear blend.
    let text input use font vertical/horizontal adjustment.

draw text in console text bar
produce output in console

events:
    add mouse events

UI:
    make it
    
SIDE STEP A LITTLE:
    - stop side step for now, go back to font stuff.
    - when I come back to this, we need to do lighting + simd


serialization/deserialization
improve render pipeline
add directx render pipeline
maybe dynamic array

--- What I learned ---
----------------------

2/24/2023:
    - learned the value of rect and rect helper functions

2/26/2023:
    - learned an easier way to do events from our good man JB
    - nice file separation

2/27/2023:
    - learned about worldspace, screenspace, pixelspace.
        worldspace is usually some real world unit of measurement that represent everything in the game
        screenspace is usualyl a (0 - 1) ratio of the screen w/h, which makes it easier to deal with UI elements and such
        pixelspace can be used as a representation, but it causes problems such as old games drawing small, and it is resolution dependent (Yuk!)
    - changed how I represent rects

3/5/2023:
    - Discord link (hopefully it doesnt expire): https://discord.com/channels/239737791225790464/1081457412977983509
    - Drawing text. Learned a lot from this. Used stb_truetype.h to load fonts and glyph bitmaps.
        Used this as reference for what the terms mean: https://i.stack.imgur.com/aWQMj.png
        baseline, left/right bearing, w/h, (x0, y0, x1, y2) rises again, kerning, advance.
        I draw bottom up, stb draws top down, was confusing for Y even though it said multiple times
            it draws top down (Should have figured it out sooner)
            visualization is never wasted
    - From here I move to

3/6/2023:
    - Bilinear filtering. I'm not doing it, and I should.
        From what I understand now, its a sample of 4 pixels. Linear blend between A`=(A, B), B`=(C, D), (A`, B`)
        and you set dest to that color.
        thats where sRGB and gamma blending comes from.

3/23/2023:
    - Back. Starting HMH vids on renderer. Gonna take a second pass on it. Hopefully it wont take too long (1/2) weeks.

4/1/2023:
    - Got my basis(origin, x_axis, y_axis) working.
    - Got scale rotation sheer working
    - Video captured for web documentation.
        a) rotating 3 small rects
        b) rotating 1 large rect with 4 small rects on point (step between A and C)

4/7/2023:
    - flux: added -Wconversion -Werror -Wall -Wextra and fixed all my type conversion errors and a bunch of other errors
    - base: added -Wconversion -Werror -Wall -Wextra and fixed all my type conversion errors and a bunch of other errors
